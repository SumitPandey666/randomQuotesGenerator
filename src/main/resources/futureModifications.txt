ORDER BY RAND() in repo --> It is incredibly easy to write and works perfectly for databases with < 100,000 rows.
 As database grows to millions of quotes, ORDER BY RAND() becomes slow because MySQL has to assign a random number to every single row in the table and then sort them.
The Future (DSA Approach): In future "Smart Generator" version, we will replace this with Reservoir Sampling or ID Offset Selection (picking a random ID between Min and Max) to make it instant at scale

Create a separate QuoteResponseDTO class that only contains the fields we want to show (content, author name, tag names) and map the Entity to the DTO in the Service layer.
To handler infinte recursive loop which is currently handled by @JsonIgnore
