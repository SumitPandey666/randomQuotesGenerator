When he says anything positive about the opposition, normally he never singles out players.'' According to Roger, Shankly burst into the dressing room in his usual aggressive style and said, ''We''re playing Manchester United this afternoon, and really it''s an insult that we have to let them on to our field because we are superior to them in every department, but they are in the league so I suppose we have to play them.
