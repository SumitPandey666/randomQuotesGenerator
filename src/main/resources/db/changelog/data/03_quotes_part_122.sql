I''ve got £260 in my savings account and I really want you to use it for that. Really, I mean it-lunch is on me. Make sure you have pudding-sticky toffee, chocolate fudge cake, ice-cream sundae, something really bad for you. Get drunk too if you like (but don''t scare Cal). Spend all the money.And after that, when days have gone by, keep an eye out for me. I might write on the steam in the mirror when you''re having a bath, or play with the leaves on the apple tree when you''re out in the garden. I might slip into a dream.Visit my grave when you can, but don''t kick yourself if you can''t, or if you move house and it''s suddenly too far away. It looks pretty there in the summer (check out the website). You could bring a picnic and sit with me. I''d like that.OK.
