But if suffering is good, ought it not to be pursued rather than avoided? I answer that suffering is not good in itself.

Usually, partners who are unable to respond compassionately when hearing us speak our pain, whether they understand it or not, are unable to listen because that expressed hurt triggers their own feelings of powerlessness and helplessness. Many men never want to feel helpless or vulnerable. They will, at times, choose to silence a partner with violence rather than witness emotional vulnerability. When a couple can identify this dynamic, they can work on the issue of caring, listening to each other''s pain by engaging in short conversations at appropriate times (i.e., it''s useless to try and speak your pain to someone who is bone weary, irritable, reoccupied, etc.).

The couple, that is, makes around itself a household economy that involves the work of both wife and husband, that gives them a measure of economic independence and self-employment, a measure of freedom, as well as a common ground and a common satisfaction.
